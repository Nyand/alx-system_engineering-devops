## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:
0. Script that displays its own PID.
1. Script that displays a list of currently running processes.

3. Script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.
4. Script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.
5. Script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

7. Script that displays 'To infinity and beyond' indefinitely with a sleep 2 in between each iteration 'I am invincible!!!'' when receiving a SIGTERM signal
8. Script that kills the process 7-highlander.
9. Script that creates the file /var/run/holbertonscript.pid containing its PID
10. Script that indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
11. C program that creates 5 zombie processes.
